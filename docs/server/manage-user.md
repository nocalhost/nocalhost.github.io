The user in Nocalhost is different from that in Kubernetes. The Nocalhost user is designed for managing their access of resources in Nocalhost Server.

Nocalhost will create an admin account automatically, which we used to sign in previously.  We should also create accounts for other members of our team.

Select the `User` tab in the sidebar and click the `Add User` button. Input the name, email and password and makesure that the `Whether to activate the use status` is enabled.

Create a user to continue. Set it's e-mail to `test@test.com` and use the password `123456`. Click the confirm button.
