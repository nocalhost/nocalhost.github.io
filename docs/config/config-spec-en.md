      image: codingcorp-docker.pkg.coding.net/nocalhost/dev-images/golang:zsh
      workDir: /home/nocalhost-dev
      sidecarImage: nocalhost-docker.pkg.coding.net/nocalhost/public/nocalhost-sidecar:sshversion
      shell: /bin/zsh
      persistentVolumeDirs:
        - path: /the/path/you/want/to/persistent/in/container
          capacity: 10Gi
        - path: /other
