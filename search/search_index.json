Cluster Cluster is a concept of Nocalhost. It usually corresponds to a Kubernetes cluster. Nocalhost supports to connect to multi-clusters, which can be GKE, minikube and microK8s. In the actual development process, users do not need to know the concept of Cluster, and user's operation under DevSpace actually rely on the capabilities of Cluster. Cluster Management Cluster is generally used with DevSpace, if you need to manage Cluster, you need to install and setup Nocalhost Server, you can read Nocalhost Server Quick Start and Using Nocalhost Server \u3002 Manage Cluster If you want to manage a Cluster\uff0cthen need to maintain a kubeConfig with the cluster's Cluster-Admin role. DevSpace DevSpace is a concept of Nocalhost, which represents a pre-allocated cloud development space managed by Nocalhost. Developers can deploy, uninstall, develop, and debug applications in DevSpace at any time. DevSpaces are isolated from each other. Nocalhost also allow developers to share their DevSpaces with other developers for collaborative development. Because of the isolation of DevSpace, it can also be used as a test environment. DevSpace Management If you need to manage DevSpace, you need to install and setup Nocalhost Server, you can read Nocalhost Server Quick Start and Using Nocalhost Server \u3002 Application Application is a concept of Nocalhost, it is mainly used to manage a set of manifest files you want to apply for local development, it supports both Kubernetes manifest and helm chart. In other words, these manifests usually contain all the k8s resources that your own application depends on. If possible, we should try to keep it to a minimum. Nocalhost supports three types of applications: Manifest Helm Kustomize Application can be used to create a DevSpace , we recommend using IDE plug-in directly to deploy your application, IDE plugin is worked on the DevSpace created by Application. In other words, after being assigned a DevSpace, the developer can easily develop on the IDE. After being assigned a DevSpace, you will get a kubeconfig to access this DevSpace, nhctl or plug-in can deploy the application based on the application's manifest file and kubeconfig. So DevSpace can actually be approximated as Application + kubeconfig : Application Management If you need to manage Applicationace, you need to install and setup Nocalhost Server, you can read Nocalhost Server Quick Start and Using Nocalhost Server . Application Configuration Read Best Practice of Application \u3002 Service Service is completely different from svc of Kubernetes. Service can be considered as an enhancement of Deployment, corresponding to a specify service in your application. Service currently supports: Configure the Nocalhost Dev-Mode, such as which directory after entering the DevContainer, which files are synchronized to the development container, etc. Supports deployment startup sequence control based on dependencies Service Congiguration Read Best Practice of Service \u3002 Note Service configurations are not necessary, only needs to be configured when you need it. User User belongs to the independent concept of Nocalhost, it's different with Kubernetes's user. When you use Nocalhost Server and Nocalhost Plugins, User is used to identify your identity and access control to resources. There are two types of User in Nocalhost: Standard User and System Admin Standard User Can only log in IDE Plugin, users can develop under their own DevSpace. these DevSpace are all created by Administrator. User can only see their own DevSpace, and have all the permissions under these DevSpace, such as install, uninstall (deploy and destroy), enter DevMode and port-forwarding. Cannot log in to Nocalhost-Web, nor can they delete the DevSpace, or disassociate it from the DevSpace, which is very similar to the admin permission under a certain namespace of Kubernetes. System Admin Has the permission to access Nocalhost Server, and with all the permissions in Nocalhost Web, such as create and manage Application, Cluster, User, DevSpace, etc Have all the permissions of User , such as logging in at IDE plugins, develop in their own DevSpace list User Management If you need to manage User, you need to install and setup Nocalhost Server, you can read Nocalhost Server Quick Start and Using Nocalhost Server . DevMode DevMode refers to a state corresponding to the microservice workload when the developer uses Nocalhost for microservice development. In this state, the workload will be converted into a mode that can easily support developers to develop debugging programs. In the existing Nocalhost development environment that based on Kubernetes, the main changes in DevMode are as follows: The number of copies of the workload will be adjusted to 1 The Pod's health check will be disabled (it is convenient to keep trying to restart the process for debugging during the development) Pod container will be replaced with DevContainer SecurityContext will be disabled A Nocalhost-Sidecar container will be injected into Pod, in order to support remote file synchronization Pod will be added with a Volume to support file sharing between DevContainer and Nocalhost-Sidecar DevContainer DevContainer is a basic environment for users to support the development and debugging of a specify microservice component. This environment is packaged into a container, which often contains a full set of SDKs , development and debugging tools, and other tools for developing this microservice component. When the service workload is switched to DevMode , Nocalhost will use DevContainer to replace the original workload container. DevContainer's life cycle runs through the entire development and debugging process, it created when DevMode starts. During the life cycle, local source code changes will be automatically synchronized to DevContainer , and can be directly compiled and deployed in the container.

In this guide, we'll walk you through how to install Nocalhost, and use Nocalhost to experience the convenient Cloud Native applications development on Kubernetes. Prerequisites Configured Kubernetes Cluster (with 2 Core and 4G Memory) which can either be a cluster for local development, such as minikube or Docker Kubernetes cluster, or any public Kubernetes cluster, such as Tencent TKE . RBAC must be enabled in above cluster Configured kubeconfig file that has namespace admin privilege Visual Studio Code (1.52+) Kubernetes api-server can be accessed internal and external Step 1: Install Make sure you have finished the Nocalhost VSCode plugin following Client Installation If you are using linux, you should increase your inotify limit otherwise file-synchronization may be slow. Step 2: Configure and use Nocalhost extension in VSCode Open Extension Open the VSCode, click on the Nocalhost icon on the sidebar, open the Nocalhost plugin Add Kubernetes cluster You can add a Kubernetes cluster by two methods: - Select kubeconfig file to select the kubeconfig file from your local path. Note Nocalhost will try to load kubeconfig from your local ~/.kube/config by default. - Paste as text to paste the kubeconfig plain text. Tip You can check your kubeconfig by using kubectl config view --minify --raw --flatten After the kubeconfig file successfully loaded, select the context that you want to access, then add the cluster. Nocalhost will automatically show the cluster list once you successfully add cluster: Tip We will using the bookinfo application as an example here. You can use your own application that already deployed in your Kubernetes clusters, or you can follow Deploy Demo Application to deploy demo app in your Kubernetes clusters. Step 3: Start DevMode Select the application that you want to develop, we are using the bookinfo app as example. Select the productpage service, click to start the DevMode , specify the source code directory (clone from Git repo or use existing local directory) Note If you want to change the Git repo after url has set, you can click to modify the gitUrl option in the yaml file After specify the source code directory (or successfully clone the code), Nocalhost will open a new VSCode window, then will automatically start the DevMode. When DevMode completed, you should see the following message: Starting DevMode... ... Waiting pod to start... Forwarding 39080:9080 Response: {\"errInfo\":\"\"} Port-forward 39080:9080 has been started \u2713 Dev container has been updated ... Tip Nocalhost will automatically run port-forward to a pod in a Kubernetes cluster. In this case, local port 39080 forwards data to port 9080 on the defined pod. You can access this pod via http://127.0.0.1:39080 after the main process started Step 4: Change the code and check the result Let's make some code change and see how Nocalhost works Execute sh command in remote terminal to start the python process sh run.sh Main process within container In DevMode, the application main process will not automatically start by default in the DevContainer, thus the application will not response any request.

Motivation Because microservice brings development and deployment flexibility and technology versatility, more and more companies choose to use microservice architecture to build applications. At the same time, the rapid development and popularization of cloud-native technology and Kubernetes have further solved the problems of service invocation overhead, distributed system transactions, debugging and service governance of microservices. Therefore, the development trend of modern applications is evolving from the original \"monolithic application + cloud\" to \"microservice + cloud-native\". Although the development trend has greatly improved the efficiency of application operation, maintenance and deployment, but a key node has been forgot: the development phase. First, although Kubernetes does an excellent job of managing the infrastructure, it brings additional complexity and a steep learning curve. The lack of Kubernetes abstraction for developers affects the development experience and reduces development efficiency. Developers have to spend a lot of energy on concept learning, system configuration, environment deployment, and resource management. On the other hand, many companies today are in the practice of \"microservices\", the granularity of splitting is too tiny, leading to a further sharp increase in the number of microservice, and the relationship between services is becoming more and more complex. Various problems are particularly prominent when you want to add new requirements. This leads to the following problems for developers and managers: Developer How to quickly start a complete development environment? How to quickly debug these dozens or even hundreds of microservices? How to collaborate with other colleagues once the requirements are depends on others? At the same time, containerization technology solves the problem of environmental consistency in the development, testing, and production stages of microservice applications. But the efficiency of the development feedback loop has caused many dev teams to have a headache. Developers need to wait for several minutes before they can see the result after codes modification. This greatly reduce development efficiency. Therefore, although companies can benefit from \"microservices + cloud-native\". But in fact, the development efficiency of many development teams does not increase but declines, and they cannot experience the \"cost reduction and efficiency increase\" brought by cloud-native technology. The end result is that people begin to question the value of Kubernetes to developers themselves: \"Why need to bother with all these details instead of focusing on coding?\". What is Nocalhost? Nocalhost is a cloud-native development tool based on IDE, and also provides cloud-native solutions, works to improve your experience creating cloud-native application within your favorite IDE. - One-click connect to development environment Help developers connect to the remote Kubernetes by one click, and get rid of the pesky local environment configurations - No need to rebuild or redeploy When developing, Nocalhost can automatically synchronize the code to container every time you make a change. This way, eliminate the submit, building and pushing cycles, greatly speed up the feedback loop of development. So you see updates in under a second - Independent and isolated development space Each developer can have their own independent development space to ensure that they will not be interfered by others during the development and testing process and process. - Visual IDE Plugin Nocalhost provides JetBrains and VSCode with an easy-to-use IDE plugin. Developers can quickly develop and remotely debug cloud-native applications on the local computer without being familiar with kubectl commands. . Architecture The overall working diagram of Nocalhost is as follows: IDE Plugins IDE plugin packs the capabilities of nhctl and nocalhost-api development environment management to provide users with a better experience. nhctl nhctl is the core component of nocalhost, here are the core features: Deploy/Uninstall Applications Nocalhost can deploy applications to Kubernetes cluster or uninstall application from DevSpace. Hot Reloading Via File Sync Any changes made to the local source codes will be synchronized to the remote DevContainer automatically. Developer can recompile and restart their process to verify code changes. In the future, we will support configure hotreload commands instead of restart processes manually. nocalhost-web nocalhost-web provides a web dashboard to manage users, development kubernetes clusters, applications and DevSpaces. nocalhost-api Nocalhost manages serviceAccount, namespace and application in kubernetes cluster through api-server, and persists to database, providing data support for IDE plugin usage. nocalhost-dep When application microservices are deployed in a Kubernetes cluster, there is no way to controler the startup sequence and dependencies of these microservices. A typical scenario is: Service A and Service B both rely on Mysql, Redis, RabbitMQ. Service A and Service B cannot be started unless these dependent services are available. Usually developers have to wait the Pod's restarting rely on Kubernetes' HealthCheck Probe. After restarting again and again, the time interval will be very long. This is why many large system running in Kubernetes start up extremely slow. By implemented a Kubernetes Admission Webhook like Istio injecting Sidecar, nocalhost-dep can controls the starting order.

Author: Jimmy Song , this blog is originally posted on Jimmy's Blog . This article explains three patterns/tools for debugging microservices in Kubernetes and the changes brought by the introduction of Istio for debugging microservices. Kubernetes is arguably the best environment for running microservices so far, but the experience of debugging microservices in a Kubernetes environment may not be as user-friendly. This article will show you how to debug microservices in Kubernetes, introduce common tools, and explain how the introduction of Istio impacts debugging microservices. Debugging microservices is vastly different from traditional monolithic applications The debugging of microservices has been a long-standing problem for software developers. This challenge does not exist in traditional monolithic applications because developers can leverage the debugger in IDEs to add breakpoints, modify environment variables, single-step execution, etc. for their applications, all of which provide great help in software debugging. With the popularity of Kubernetes, the debugging of microservices becomes a thorny issue, where the following issues are more complicated than the debugging of traditional monolithic applications. Multiple dependencies A microservice often depends on multiple other microservices, some shared volumes across multiple microservices, and authorizations based on service accounts. When debugging a microservice, how do you deploy other dependent services to quickly build a latest set of staging environments? Access from a local machine When microservices are running on a developer\u2019s local computer, there is usually no direct access to the services in a Kubernetes cluster. How can you debug microservices deployed in a Kubernetes cluster as if they were local services? Slow development loop Usually, it takes a long process to update the code and build it into an image before pushing it to the cluster. How do you speed up the development cycle? Let\u2019s look at the tools that address those challenges. Tools The main solutions for debugging microservices in Kubernetes are: Proxy: by building a VPN, deploying a proxy in the Kubernetes cluster, and adding local debug endpoints to make the services in Kubernetes directly accessible to local applications, your architecture will look like [ local service ] <-> [ proxy ] <-> [ app in Kubernetes ]. Sidecar: Inject a sidecar into the pod of the microservice to be debugged to intercept all traffic to and from the service, so that the service can be tracked and monitored, and the service can also be debugged in this sidecar. Service Mesh: To get an overall picture of the application, inject sidecars into all microservices so that you can get a dashboard that monitors global status. Here are three typical open source projects that implement the above solutions, each of which can help you debug microservices from a different perspective. You can apply them at different stages of software development and they can be said to be complementary to each other. Proxy \u2013 debugging microservices with Telepresence Telepresence is essentially a local proxy that proxies data volumes, environment variables, and networks in a Kubernetes cluster locally. The following diagram shows the main usage scenarios for Telepresence. Users need to manually execute the telepresence command locally, which will automatically deploy the agent to Kubernetes. Once the agent has been deployed, Local services will have complete access to other services in the Kubernetes cluster, environment variables, Secret, ConfigMap, etc. Services in the cluster also have direct access to the locally exposed endpoints. However, this approach requires users to run multiple commands while debugging locally, and in some network environments it may not be possible to establish a VPN connection to the Kubernetes cluster. Sidecar \u2013 debugging microservices with Nocalhost Nocalhost is a Kubernetes-based cloud development environment. To use it, you just need to install a plugin in your IDE \u2013 VS Code to extend Kubernetes and shorten the development feedback cycle. The development environment can be isolated by creating different namespaces for different users and using ServiceAccount when binding to different user corners. Nocalhost also provides a web console and API for administrators to manage different development environments. As long as you have a Kubernetes cluster and have admin rights to the cluster, you can refer to the Nocalhost documentation to quickly start trying it out. To use the Nocalhost plugin in VS Code, you need to configure the Kubernetes cluster in the plugin first. Select the Kubeconfig file you just exported or copy and paste the contents of the file directly into the configuration. Then select the service you need to test and select the corresponding Dev Container. VS Code will automatically open a new code window. Here is an example of the bookinfo sample provided by Istio. You can open the cloned code in your local IDE and click the hammer next to the code file to enter development mode. Selecting the corresponding DevContainer and Nocalhost will automatically inject a development container sidecar into the pod and automatically enter the container in the terminal, as shown in the following figure. In development mode, the code is modified locally without rebuilding the image, and the remote development environment takes effect in real time, which can greatly accelerate the development speed. At the same time, Nocalhost also provides a server for managing the development environment and user rights, as shown in the following figure. Service Mesh \u2013 debugging microservices with Istio The above method of using proxy and sidecar can only debug one service at a time. You\u2019ll need a mesh to get the global status of the application, such as the metrics of the service obtained, and debug the performance of the service by understanding the dependency and invocation process of the service through distributed tracing. These observability features need to be implemented by injecting sidecar uniformly for all services. And, when your services are in the process of migrating from VMs to Kubernetes, using Istio can bring VMs and Kubernetes into a single network plane (as shown below), making it easy for developers to debug and do incremental migrations. Of course, these benefits do not come without a \u201ccost.\u201d With the introduction of Istio, your Kubernetes services will need to adhere to the Istio naming convention and you\u2019ll need to know how to debug microservices using the Istioctl command line and logging. Use the istioctl analyze command to debug the deployment of microservices in your cluster, and you can use YAML files to examine the deployment of resources in a namespace or across your cluster. Use istioctl proxy-config secret to ensure that the secret of a pod in a service mesh is loaded correctly and is valid. Summary In the process of microservicing applications and migrating from virtual machines to Kubernetes, developers need to make a lot of changes in their mindset and habits. By building a VPN between local and Kubernetes via proxy, developers can easily debug services in Kubernetes as if they were local services. By injecting a sidecar into the pod, you can achieve real-time debugging and speed up the development process. Finally, the Istio service mesh truly enables global observability, and you can also use tools like Tetrate Service Bridge to manage heterogeneous platforms, helping you gradually move from monolithic applications to microservices.","title":"How to debug microservices in Kubernetes with proxy, sidecar or service mesh?"},{"location":"eng/Blog/how-to-debug-microservices-in-kubernetes-with-proxy-sidecar-or-service-mesh/#how-to-debug-microservices-in-kubernetes-with-proxy-sidecar-or-service-mesh","text":"Author: Jimmy Song , this blog is originally posted on Jimmy's Blog .

At the same time, the enterprise's production materials: application systems, have also become larger and larger. In order to adapt the application system to the adjustment of the enterprise organizational structure and sort out the boundaries of the organizational structure for application rights and responsibilities, most organizations will choose to use the \"microservice\" architecture to split the application system horizontally, so that the maintenance boundary of the application system is adapted The power and responsibility boundary of the organizational structure. Generally speaking, the larger the organizational structure, the more detailed the application system will be, and the number of \"microservices\" will also increase. In the practice of splitting \"microservices\", it is easy to mark the authority and responsibility boundaries of the organizational structure into the splitting granularity of \"microservices\", which may lead to too fine granularity of \"microservices\". The problem of further sharp increase in number. In the end, the calling relationship between \"microservices\" is like cross-departmental collaboration, and it has become more and more complex. The problem is particularly prominent when you want to add new requirements. While \"microservices\" bring convenience, it also brings additional challenges for developers: how to quickly start a complete development environment? The development requirements depend on how other colleagues can coordinate and debug? How to quickly debug these microservices? For managers, it also brings a series of challenges: how to manage the development environment of developers? How to let new colleagues quickly develop? Imagine what difficulties would you encounter when developing a cloud-native application consisting of 200 \"microservices\"? Localhost era In the era of monolithic applications, it is extremely friendly to developers. Developers use the local machine to run the application, modify the code to take effect in real time, and visit Localhost through a browser to view the code effect in real time. Monolithic applications are different from \"microservices\" applications. Monolithic applications are organized as \"ALL-IN-ONE\". All calling relationships are limited to their own classes and functions, and the hardware requirements of applications are generally not too high. The development of \"microservice\" applications is quite different. Due to the mutual dependence, when a certain function or microservice needs to be developed, all dependent services have to be activated. With the increase in the number of microservices, more and more local resources are needed to develop applications, which ultimately leads to the local inability to meet the configuration requirements of development. Cloud Native liberates deployment and operation, What about development? The popularity of cloud native and Kubernetes further shields the complexity of \"microservice\" applications, which is mainly reflected in the deployment and operation and maintenance stages. In order to solve the problem of environmental consistency in the development, testing, and production stages of microservice applications, modern microservice application development will package each component into a Docker image and deploy it in the form of workload. Using continuous integration and continuous deployment in the DevOps pipeline, combined with Kubernetes probes, HPA, and application self-healing capabilities, completely liberated the deployment and operation and maintenance of microservice applications. But we overlooked a key node: the development phase. After microservice applications are packaged with Kubernetes workloads, the problem of rapid application startup in the development process is solved. Developers only need to install a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally, such as Minikube, Kind, etc., to quickly start microservice applications. But for developers, the original monolithic application development experience no longer exists. Since the application is difficult to run outside of the Docker container, each code modification needs to go through the following steps: Execute docker build to build the image Execute docker tag to tag the image Execute docker push to push the image to the warehouse Modify the image version of the Kubernetes workload Wait for the mirror pull to end Wait for the Pod to rebuild View the modified code effect This directly slows down the cyclic feedback process of development, and each modification requires several minutes or even ten minutes of waiting time. Redefine Cloud Native Dev Environment Nocalhost is a Cloud Native development environment, hoping to make developing cloud-native applications as primitive and simple as developing a single application. Nocalhost reorganized the roles and resources involved in the development process: Team manager Developer Application Cluster Development Space Through the reintegration of these roles and resources, Nocalhost redefines the cloud-native development environment and brings a new cloud-native development experience. In order to quickly understand the cloud-native development environment redefined by Nocalhost, let us first stand in different roles and see what Nocalhost can bring to them. Developer: Get rid of the need to rebuild a new image for each modification and long-term loop feedback, and the modified code will take effect immediately. One-click deployment of the development environment, get rid of the limitations of local environment construction and insufficient resources. Link between local IDE editor and development environment, support remote debugging. Graphical IDE plug-in, no need to be familiar with kubectl commands to complete development in cloud native environment. Manager: Unified management of microservice application packages, reducing application maintenance costs. Unified management of the development environment and cluster, improve the utilization of cluster resources, and have isolation characteristics. Quickly allocate development environment for new employees, and application development can be carried out immediately after the allocation of the environment. Flexible development environment resources can be destroyed when used up, reducing development costs. Taking Nocalhost's built-in Demo: Bookinfo as an example, the development of Productpage microservices has become the following simple steps: One-click deployment development environment: Environment deployment is complete, select the component to be developed, click \"hammer\" to enter the development mode: Clone business code or select local code directory to open: Enter the development mode, modify the code locally and save it, no need to rebuild the mirror image, the remote development environment takes effect in real time, and supports remote debugging: Landing case Currently, Tencent Cloud CODING DevOps (nearly 200 microservices) is using Nocalhost for development.

Increase Inotify Limit If your file synchronization is too slow in linux, it is most likely due to inotify limit. How do I increase the inotify limit to get my filesystem watcher to work? Linux typically restricts the amount of watches per user (usually 8192). When you have more directories you need to adjust that number. On many Linux distributions you can run the following to fix it: echo \"fs.inotify.max_user_watches=204800\" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf On Arch Linux and potentially others it is preferred to write this line into a separate file, i.e. you should run: echo \"fs.inotify.max_user_watches=204800\" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/90-override.conf This only takes effect after a reboot.

By default, Nocalhost recognizes services by the exact name of workloads in the cluster. But the name of the workloads installed by Helm may be generated according to the Chart templates. For example, if the Chart is created with the template provided by Helm, Nocalhost may find it by looking for workloads with name formed with <release-name>-<service-name> . For example, there is a service defined in config.yaml as following: ... services: - name: productpage serviceType: deployment When we install a application(helm) by nhctl as following: $ nhctl install dev -u <git-repo-url> $ kubectl get deployment -n test NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE dev-productpage 0/1 1 0 9s Nocalhost will consider the workload dev-productpage as the service named productpage defined in config.yaml, while no workload named productpage in cluster. In other case, if you create Chart with other templates or install Chart in other ways, Nocalhost cannot find the services in the config.yaml. In this situation, you should configure the exact name of the workloads to Nocalhost's config.yaml. Using static workload names is recommended. Does Nocalhost have support to develop components(services) which have Pods running multiple containers? You can specify container's name in V2 Nocalhost config file. Why does my code fail to compile in the DevMode under Windows? The issue may be caused by differences of line endings between different operating systems. For example, the code is compiled for Linux with line endings of \\n , and you checkout, edit or reformat the code under Windows may convert line endings to \\r\\n . The conversion of line endings will lead to failures on some build tools (like Gradle). Therefore, before entering the DevMode, you should configure the local development environment as needed. git: In default, line ending conversions are enabled. It means that git checkout will convert \\n to \\r\\n and git commit will convert \\r\\n to \\n . Please refer to Git Docs if you have to configure it. Visual Studio Code: In default, line ending is \\r\\n under Windows. Configure it globally by entering File -> Preferences -> Settings -> Text Editor -> Files -> Eol, or click the CRLF or LF on the right of the status bar when converting for a single file. IntelliJ IDEA: In default, line ending is \\r\\n under Windows. Configure it by entering File -> Settings -> Editor -> Code Style -> Line seperator. Does Nocalhost have support to develop components(services) that controls by Deployments with HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)? No. It is suggested that remove HPA controller from Deployments before developing components(services) with Nocalhost. Why there isn't a register link? How to login Nocalhost Web? Nocalhost does not support self-registration. By now, Nocalhost Server(api and web) is designed using by administrator. Administrator can sign in with the default administrator account email and password. The default account's Email is: admin@admin.com The default account's password is: 123456 After signed in, they can change admin user's Email and password. They can also manage users, clusters and applications. Does Nocalhost have support to develop components(services) which depend on Kubernetes cluster resources such as Namespaces, ClusterRole? It is not supported by Visual Studio Code plugin and Nocalhost Server, but Nocalhost CLI tool nhctl supports. We will support later.

How Service Supports DevMode We use the following productpage configuration of this microservice as an example to illustrate several key configuration items that Service supports development mode : - name: productpage serviceType: deployment dependLabelSelector: jobs: - \"dep-job\" containers: - name: productpage install: portForward: - 39080:9080 dev: gitUrl: https://e.coding.net/codingcorp/nocalhost/bookinfo-productpage.git image: codingcorp-docker.pkg.coding.net/nocalhost/dev-images/python:3.7.7-slim-productpage shell: bash workDir: /home/nocalhost-dev sync: type: send filePattern: - ./ ignoreFilePattern: - \".git\" - \".github\" - \".idea\" portForward: - 39080:9080 name and serviceType When you want to use Service , name and serviceType are required items , used to locate a manifest, currently Nocalhost only supports Deployment a serviceType . In the above example, the serviceType of productpage is Deployment : - name: productpage serviceType: deployment gitUrl It is used to indicate the source code repo url corresponding to this microservice. When entering the DevMode , you can choose to synchronize a local directory to the development container, or you can choose to pull it from a remote warehouse. If you have configured gitUrl when entering DevMode , Nocalhost will automatically clone the codes from this gitUrl for you. For example: containers: ... dev: gitUrl: https://e.coding.net/codingcorp/nocalhost/bookinfo-productpage.git ... image You can use your own image for the container when entering DevMode, for example: containers: ... dev: gitUrl: https://e.coding.net/codingcorp/nocalhost/bookinfo-productpage.git image: codingcorp-docker.pkg.coding.net/nocalhost/dev-images/python:3.7.7-slim-productpage ... workDir (Optional) It is used to indicate the working directory in remote container after entering the DevMode and the directory where the synchronized files are stored. By default, /home/nocalhost-dev will be used. containers: ... dev: ... workDir: /home/nocalhost-dev ... ... sync (Optional) You can select a group of configuration items, choose which folders of the source directory to synchronize to the development container, the default value is \".\" . The type of file synchronization can be either sent one-way or sendreceive two-way. containers: ... sync: type: send filePattern: - ./ ignoreFilePattern: - .git - .github - .idea ... portForward There are two port-forward configurations Automatically Port-Forward after Application Deployment After the application is successfully installed, Nocalhost will automatically forwarded the remote port to the local port, and then can quickly access remote running result through the local port. The configuration format is local port: remote port , for example: ... containers: - name: productpage install: portForward: - 39080:9080 Automatically Port-Forward when Entered DevMode After entering the DevMode, Nocalhost will automatically forwarded the remote port to the local port, and then can quickly access remote running result through the local port. The configuration format is local port: remote port , for example: containers: ... portForward: - 39080:9080 It is also possible to support not specifying the local port, such as :10000 . Nocalhost will randomly forward the designated remote port to a local port. More Configuration Information Please refer to Nocalhost Configuration for more detailed configuration of Nocalhost. Service Specify Startup Sequence Dependencies Nocalhost supports control startup sequence based on dependencies. Kubernetes version limit This feature depends on Kubernetes admission webhooks , so please ensure that the minimum version of the Kubernetes cluster is v1.16.0 or Above, and make sure to enable MutatingAdmissionWebhook and ValidatingAdmissionWebhook controllers. dependLabelSelector The label selector of the workload that the service depends on. There are two configuration items here: pods Specify the dependent Pods label selector (the current service will wait for the selected Pod by the label selector to be in the Ready state before starting) For example, productpage depends on another Pod named foo , then productpage can be configured as follows: - name: productpage serviceType: deployment dependLabelSelector: pods: - \"name=foo\" - \"app.kubernetes.io/name=foo\" jobs Specify the dependent Jobs label selector (the current service will wait for the selected job by the label selector to execute before starting) For example, productpage depends on another job named bar , then productpage can be configured as follows: - name: productpage serviceType: deployment dependLabelSelector: jobs: - \"job-name=bar\" - \"app.kubernetes.io/name=bar\"","title":"Service Best Practice"},{"location":"eng/best-practice/service-best/#service-configuration","text":"","title":"Service Configuration"},{"location":"eng/best-practice/service-best/#1-do-not-configure-service","text":"Service does not have to be configured.
